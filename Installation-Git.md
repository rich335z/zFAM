## Installation

### Installation prerequisite
If you plan on using the supplied assembly and link job, you will need to customize the DFHEITAL and DFHYITVL procs from
the CICS SDFHPROC library. For further information regarding this proc, see...
http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.3.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.applicationprogramming.doc/topics/dfhp3_installprog_cicsproc.html

### Installation planning
The enterprise file access method service will most likely need to be available for each part of the development lifecycle
such as unit testing, QA testing, integration testing and production. One or more CICS regions may be assigned to each of
these development lifecyles or environments. Each environment will have its own expiry management file. The same instance
can be deployed across each of the environments. A common naming convention for the environments must be followed such as
DEV, QA and PROD. The environment name cannot exceed eight characters.

### Security ###
The default CICS userid will need access to run each instance of the transaction ID. It is recommended a block of
transactions be reserved for the service. The supplied definitions assume the ZFAM transactions will begin with "FA"
giving a range of FA00 to FAZZ.

For those implementations using https and a TCPIPService definition with the AUTHENTICATE parameter set to BASIC, the
authenticated userid will also need access to the transaction.

Administrators should have access to transaction FPLT to start the expiration process.

### Network Considerations ###
The strategy used by this implementation uses a cluster of application owner regions (AORs). No webservice owning
regions (WORs) are employed to route requests over to the AORs. It leverages a combination of sysplex distributor and
port sharing.

The port or ports reserved for this service are defined to a virtual IP address (VIPA) distribute statement (VIPADIST)
and the port is defined as a shared port (SHAREP). Binding the port to the distributed VIPA is optional. With this
arrangement, CICS regions are free to move around and supports more than one region on a LPAR.

The preferred approach is to use a unique host name per instance which will allow a single instance to be moved without
affecting any other instances. The unique host names would be assigned to the VIPA distribute address assigned to the
port(s). An example of unique host name would be zfam01.enterprise-services.mycompany.com matching instance FA01.

The drawback for using a unique host name per instance is certificate handling for https implementations. Either a
wildcard SSL certificate needs to be issued or the SSL certificate needs to have every host name in the subject
alternate name. Using the example above, the wildcard certificate would need to match on
*.enterprise-services.mycompany.com. For the latter scenario, an automated process to add the instance host name to
the subject altername name would be needed to streamline the process.

To provide redundancy across sysplexes a router would be needed to send requests to both sysplexes. Implementing this
level of redundancy requires additional host names to be utilized. There would be the primary host name the application
would use. This host name would be routed among the host names assigned to each sysplex. Using the example above,
the host name supplied to the application would be zfam01.enterprise-services.mycompany.com which would be configured
to be picked up by the router. The router would then choose a sysplex host name to use which could look something like
zfam01.sysplex01.enterprise-services.mycompany.com and zfam01.sysplex02.enterprise-services.mycompany.com. These host
names would be the ones pointing to the VIPA distribute address on their respective sysplex.

### Installation instructions
1. [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to your user account.

1. From z/OS, identify a directory in USS to house the project and navigate into it.

1. Clone the project from your forked repo:

        git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/zFAM.git

1. You will now have a local project that contains an association to a remote named `origin`, which is your forked repo. In order to pull subsequent changes from the _original_ repo to your local project, an additional remote named `upstream` should be added to your project. Change into the working directory and add the `upstream` remote:

        git remote add upstream git://github.com/walmart/zFAM.git

1. In the working directory, there is a script named `Git2zos.exec`. This script will create a PDSE associated with each folder in the working directory and copy the respective files into those PDSE's. To run the script, first identify the values to be used for **@srclib_prfx@** and **@source_vrsn@** as described in Step 7. These values will be passed as arguments on the script invocation. _From within the working directory_, issue the command like so (the arguments are not case-sensitive):
        
        Git2zos.exec 'YOUR.SOURCELIB.PREFIX' 'V010000'

1. Copy the ZFAMFFC, ZFAMFKC and ZFAMHEX from the CPY library to a copybook library used by your own compile processes
if you do not plan on using the DFHEITAL and DFHYITVL procs.

1. *In the TXT source PDS/PDSE library, locate the CONFIG member and edit it.* This file contains a list of configuration items used to configure the JCL and source. The file itself provides a brief description of each configuration item. Comments are denoted by leading asterisk in the first word. The first word is the configuration item and the second word is its value.

    1. **@auth@** is the value of the AUTHENTICATE parameter for the https TCPIPService definition. The values can be
    NO, ASSERTED, AUTOMATIC, AUTOREGISTER, BASIC, CERTIFICATE.

    1. **@certficate@** is for CERTIFICATE parameter in the TCPIPService definition for https. Specify certificate as
    CERTIFICATE(server-ssl-certificate-name).

    1. **@cics_csd@** is the dataset name of the CICS system definition (CSD) file.

    1. **@cics_hlq@** is the high level qualifier for CICS datasets.

    1. **@csd_list@** is the CSD group list name. This is the list name to use for the ZFAM group.
    
    1. **@data_class@** is the DATACLASS used by IDCAMS for defining ZFAM files

    1. **@doct_dd@** is the document template DDNAME defined to CICS region.

    1. **@doct_lib@** is the document template dataset name defined to CICS

    1. **@zfam_hlq@** is the high level qualifier for ZFAM files.

    1. **@http_port@** is the http port number to be used for ZFAM.

    1. **@https_port@** is the https port number to be used for ZFAM.

    1. **@job_parms@** are the parameters following JOB in the JOB card. Be mindful. This substitution will only handle
    one line worth of JOB parameters when customizing jobs.

    1. **@mgt_class@** is the MANAGEMENTCLASS used by IDCAMS for defining ZFAM files.

    1. **@proc_lib@** (Optional) is the dataset containing the customized version of the DFHEITAL and DFHYITVL procs
    supplied by IBM. If you plan to use the supplied assembly job, the proc library is required.

    1. **@program_lib@** (Optional) is the dataset to be used for ZFAM programs. If you plan to use the supplied assembly
    job, the program load library is required.

    1. **@rep_port@** is the replication port number. See replication.

    1. **@srclib_prfx@** is the (potentially multi-node) prefix to be used for the various source libraries of the product. This should follow your installation standards. It could be as simple as your TSO PROFILE PREFIX, or could be a multi-node qualifier that represents your team. Of course, standard [z/OS dataset naming constraints](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.idad400/name.htm) still apply. So, keep this to something <= 30 bytes/chars (including dot-separators) to avoid issues. We require up to 14 bytes/chars on the lower qualifier end to uniquely identify the various data stores.
    
    1. **@source_vrsn@** is the version identifier to be used as the LLQ for the collection of source libraries associated with this version of the product. We generally follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines, with an exception for allowing leading zeros on the individual version/release/patch nodes in order to maintain consistency in the DSN LLQ format. The format of the version identifier that we'll follow for the foreseeable future is a 7-character DSN node like V*vvrrpp* where:
    
      _vv_ - represents major versions (i.e. breaking or non-backwards-compatible changes)
      
      _rr_ - represents minor releases (i.e. non-breaking or backwards-compatible feature changes)
      
      _pp_ - represents patches (i.e. non-breaking or backwards-compatible bug fixes)
      
      For example, V010000 is the initial version... and V010100 would represent the next _release_ with non-breaking changes, or V010001 would represent a bug-fix on the original version.

    1. **@stg_class@** is the storage class to use for ZFAM files.

    1. **@tdq@** is the transient data queue (TDQ) for error messages. Must be 4 bytes or assembly jobs could fail.

1. Exit and save the CONFIG member in the source library.

1. In the JCL library, locate and edit the CONFIG member. This is the job that will customize the JCL and source
libraries. Because this job performs the customization, it will need to be customized in order to run. The following
customizations will need to be made.

    1. Modify JOB card to meet your system installation standards.

    1. Change all occurrences of the following.
        1. **@srclib_prfx@** is the (multi-node) prefix to be used for the various source libraries of the product. Example. C ALL @srclib_prfx@ CICSTS.ZUID
        1. **@source_vrsn@** to the current version of the product source code. Example. C ALL @source_vrsn@ V010000

1. Submit the CONFIG job. It should complete with return code 0. The remaining jobs and CSD definitions have been
customized.

1. Assemble the source. An assembly and link job has been provided to assemble the programs used for ZFAM. You may use
the supplied job or use your own job.
    1. Using ASMZFAM. The provided job ASMZFAM utilizes the DFHEITAL and DFHYITVL procs from IBM for tranlating CICS
    commands. The DFHEITAL and DFHYITVL procs must be customized and available in the library specified earlier in the
    @proc_lib@ configuration item. Submit the ASMZFAM job. It should end with return code 4 or less.
    1. Using your own assembly/compile and link jobs. If you wish to use your own assembly/compile jobs, here is a list
    of programs and their languages. Copybooks ZFAMFFC, ZFAMFKC and ZFAMHEX will need to be available for Cobol compiles.
        1. ZFAMNC   *Assembler*
        1. ZFAMPLT  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM000  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM001  *Assembler*
        1. ZFAM002  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM003  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM004  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM005  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM006  *Assembler*
        1. ZFAM007  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM008  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM009  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM010  *Assembler*
        1. ZFAM011  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM020  *Assembler*
        1. ZFAM022  *Assembler*
        1. ZFAM030  *Assembler*
        1. ZFAM031  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM040  *Assembler*
        1. ZFAM041  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM090  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM101  *Cobol*
        1. ZFAM102  *Cobol*
        1. ZUIDSTCK *Assembler* (Shared with the ZUID repository)

1. Define the CICS resource definitions for ZFAM. In the JCL library, submit the CSDZFAM member. This will install the
minimum number of definitions for ZFAM.
*Note: one resource definition, the ZUIDSTCK program definition is shared with the ZUID repository. This may lead to a
duplicate program definition if both ZUID and ZFAM are installed in the same region and defined in different CSD groups.*

1. Define the http port for ZFAM (optional). If you plan to use an existing http port (TCPIPService definition), you do
not need to submit this job. If you would like to setup a http port specifically for ZFAM. Submit the CSDZFAMN member in
the JCL library.

1. Define the https port for ZFAM (optional). If you plan to use an existing https port (TCPIPService definition), you do
not need to submit this job. If you would like to setup a https port specifically for ZFAM. Submit the CSDZFAMS member in
the JCL library.

1. Define an expiry file for each of the environments discussed during the planning section. In the JCL library, edit
DEFEXPR. Change the word behind @environment@ for the environment being defined and submit.

1. Install the ZFAM CSD group. No job has been provided to install the ZFAM group on the CSD. How CSD groups are
installed varies from company to company. Cold starting CICS, using CICS Explorer, or using CEDA INSTALL are just
some of the ways to perform this action. If cold starting, you may want to hold off until the ZFAMPLT program is ready
to be picked up as entry in the PLTPI in the next few steps.

1. Define program ZFAMPLT as an entry to the PLTPI table in the regions destined to run the ZFAM services. Refer to
instructions for PLT-program list table in IBM Knowledge Center for CICS.

1. Invoke the ZFAMPLT program. This can be done by restarting the CICS region or by running the ZPLT transaction in each
of the CICS regions.

#### Define a ZFAM basic mode instance
1. Define an instance of ZFAM. In the JCL library, the DEFFA## member provides the JCL to define one instance of ZFAM.
While some parts of the job are customized, some parameters are left untouched so the process on installing a ZFAM
instance is repeatable. Keep in mind, you will want some method of keeping track of your clients and which instance of
ZFAM you have created for them. Recording the path as well is a good idea. Edit DEFFA## in the JCL library and
customize the following fields.
    1. **@appname@** is the application name using this instance of ZFAM. It is the sixth node of the path.
    1. **@cc@** is the country code of the implementation.
    1. **@environment@** is eight character environment name such as DEV, QA, PROD discussed during planning. This
    setting should match the environment setting used when defining the expiry file.
    1. **@grp_list@** is the CSD group list you wish this instance to be installed.
    1. **@id@** is the two character ZFAM instance identifier ranging from 00 to ZZ.
    1. **@org@** is the organization identifier used in the path of the service.
    1. **@pri_cyl@** is the primary number of cylinders for ZFAM files.
    1. **@reg@** is the region or boundary of the implementation.
    1. **@scheme@** is the setting for the SCHEME parameter on the URIMAP definition. Use either http or https.
    1. **@sec_cyl@** is the secondary number of cylinders for ZFAM files.
    *Note: the path is created by the @cc@, @reg@, @org@ and @appname@ values; /datastore/zFAM/@cc@/@reg@/@org@/@app_name@.*

1. Submit the DEFFA## job to define the instance.

1. Install the ZFAM instance CSD group. The CSD group name begins with FA and ends with the @id@ value used above. So if
the @id@ was 00, the group name is FA00. No job has been supplied to install the definitions. Install by cold starting
CICS, using CICS Explorer, or using CEDA INSTALL.

1. Define a named counter for the ZFAM instance and trigger the expiry process. Run transaction ZFNC in one of the CICS
regions with the above group name following it. Using the example above, the transaction would be ran as follows:
ZFNC,FA00

#### Define a ZFAM query mode instance
1. Define an instance of ZFAM. In the JCL library, the DEFFA## member provides the JCL to define one instance of ZFAM.
While some parts of the job are customized, some parameters are left untouched so the process on installing a ZFAM
instance is repeatable. Keep in mind, you will want some method of keeping track of your clients and which instance of
ZFAM you have created for them. Recording the path as well is a good idea. Edit DEFFA## in the JCL library and
customize the following fields.
    1. **@appname@** is the application name using this instance of ZFAM. It is the sixth node of the path.
    1. **@cc@** is the country code of the implementation.
    1. **@environment@** is eight character environment name such as DEV, QA, PROD discussed during planning. This
    setting should match the environment setting used when defining the expiry file.
    1. **@grp_list@** is the CSD group list you wish this instance to be installed.
    1. **@id@** is the two character ZFAM instance identifier ranging from 00 to ZZ.
    1. **@org@** is the organization identifier used in the path of the service.
    1. **@pri_cyl@** is the primary number of cylinders for ZFAM files.
    1. **@reg@** is the region or boundary of the implementation.
    1. **@scheme@** is the setting for the SCHEME parameter on the URIMAP definition. Use either http or https.
    1. **@sec_cyl@** is the secondary number of cylinders for ZFAM files.
    *Note: the path is created by the @cc@, @reg@, @org@ and @appname@ values; /datastore/zFAM/@cc@/@reg@/@org@/@app_name@.*

1. Submit the DEFFA## job to define the instance.

1. In the JCL library, edit FA##FD. Refer to the how-to documentation for the file definition settings. This section
will cover the install of the file definition. Customize the file definition in the SYSUT1 DD to specify the field names,
types and their lengths. Make a note of every "ID" number above 001. Any ID values greater than 001 are considered
alternate indexes. Alternate indexes will have to be defined in the upcoming step. Change all occurrences of ## to the
value used for @id@ when defining the instance in the DEFFA## member. The FA##FD job will create a document template
member and define it to the instance group. Submit the job. Cancel the edit session to retain the ## signs in the JCL for
the next ZFAM instance.

1. In the JCL library, edit DEFCI. The DEFCI job creates the alternate indexes defined in the file definition template
above. If the file definitions had any ID= values greater than 001, these will need to be defined as alternate indexes.
If the file defintion had ID=002 and ID=003 specified, then two alternate indexes would have to be defined. Change the
following fields in the DEFCI job.
    1. **@ci_nbr@** is the alternate index number matching the ID= value in the FA##FD. The first alternate index to be
    defined is usually 02.
    1. **@environment@** is eight character environment name such as DEV, QA, PROD discussed during planning. This
    setting should match the environment setting used when defining the expiry file.
    1. **@id@** is the two character ZFAM instance identifier ranging from 00 to ZZ. It should match the @id@ specified
    in the DEFFA## member.
    1. **@pri_cyl@** is the primary number of cylinders for ZFAM alternate index files.
    1. **@sec_cyl@** is the secondary number of cylinders for ZFAM alternate index files.

1. Submit the DEFCI job to define the alternate index. Repeat for each alternate index required. Only the @ci_nbr@ should
change between each submit.

1. Install the ZFAM instance CSD group. The CSD group name begins with FA and ends with the @id@ value used above. So if
the @id@ was 00, the group name is FA00. No job has been supplied to install the definitions. Install by cold starting
CICS, using CICS Explorer, or using CEDA INSTALL.

1. Define a named counter for the ZFAM instance and trigger the expiry process. Run transaction ZFNC in one of the CICS
regions with the above group name following it. Using the example above, the transaction would be ran as follows:
ZFNC,FA00

### Securing the ZFAM instance
Refer to the how-to documentation for the security definition settings. This section will cover the install of the
security definition.

In the JCL library, edit FA##SD. Add the userids and their permission levels to the SYSUT1 DD. Change all occurrences of
"##" to the value used for @id@ when defining the instance. The job will create a document template member and define it
to the instance group. Submit the job. Upon successful completion, install the document template definition.

### Replication
To setup replication, an alternate environment such as another sysplex will need to have the same definitions installed.
The alternate environment will have a different host name in DNS. The same ports are used with the exception of one
new port to manage the replication. Both the primary and alternate environments will have the same replication port
number.

To define the replication port, submit CSDZFAMR in the JCL library to define the ZFAMREPL TCPIPService definition. After
the job has completed, install the ZFAMREPL definition. This should be done in both the primary and alternate environments.

To enable replication for an instance of ZFAM, edit FA##DC in the JCL library and modify the SYSUT1 DD. The valid values
for type are AA, AS and A1. AA is for active-active replication. AS is for active-standby and A1 is stand alone. The
second line is the host name and port of the opposing environment. The primary environment will need to have the
alternate's host name and port defined. And the alternate environment with to have the primary's host name and port
defined. Change all occurrences of ## to the value used for @id@ when defining the instance. The job will create a
document template member and define it to the instance group. Submit the job. Upon successful completion,
install the document template definition.
